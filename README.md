# Currency Converter
This is a simple currency converter implemented in Java to improve my Java-coding expertise. It constists of a simple GUI, written with Java Swing in the `GUI.class` and the `App.java` file containing the Backend-logic. Inside the `App.java` file the `CurrencyConverter`-class is implemented, which is capable of doing a API-Request to get the current exchange-values. When a value together with a source- and target currency is inputed into the frontend, it does the conversion and give the result back to the frontend.
